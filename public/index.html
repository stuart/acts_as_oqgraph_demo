    <h1>Rails OQGraph demo</h1>
    <h3>What's this about?</h3>
    <p>This is a demonstration app showing the use of the acts_as_oqgraph gem for Ruby on Rails</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://github.com/stuart/acts_as_oqgraph_demo">source code</a> shows how to use the gem in your own applications.</p>
    <p>The demo shows how fast the OQGraph engine is at dealing with graph traversal problems in a MySQL database.</p>
    <h3>The Demos</h3>
      <p>There are currently 2 demos: <a href="mazes">mazes</a> and <a href="oqgraph_users">friends</a>.</p>
      <p>The mazes demo shows the use of OQGraph for maze solving, and the friends demo shows its use for the social networking problem of 
        getting friends of friends.</p>
