= acts_as_oqgraph Demonstration App

This is a demonstration app for the acts_as_oqgraph gem.

There are two parts to the demo: Friends and Maze.

The Friends demo simulates having a large set of interconnected users, that is Users can have friends.
It uses the OQGraph engine to efficiently find connections between users.
For info on the engine see:
http://openquery.com/products/graph-engine

The Maze simulation shows path finding in a maze using OQGraph.
The code is mainly so you can take a look and check out how acts_as_oqgraph can be used.
Feel free to use it, mash it up etc. The Maze is not very challenging as it shows you the path to the exit.
Don't complain about the clunky graphics, I'm not a designer. If you don't like them fix them and 
send me a pull request!

I'd be pleased to hear comments, criticisms and ideas.

== Requirements
This is a Rails 2.3.8 app. I have used some Ruby 1.9 specific code though the acts_as_oqgraph gem does not.
  
You will need to setup a MySQL database with the OQGraph Engine plugin. The easiest way to do this is use MariaDB 5.2 which comes
with the OQGraph engine. 

== Setup

Setup the database config and edit it to your needs:
  cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml

Edit the seed data and then create the databases.
Note that db:seed can take a LONG time (LONG means really LONG to you A.D.D. whippersnappers...hours, days even) 
to run if you have 1000000 users and a 1000x1000 maze. You'd be creating about 10 million records in a database
which is not optimised for INSERT operations.
The default settings in seeds.rb should take a few minutes but won't test the OQGraph engine to it's limits.
I've done nothing to optimise this as it's only run once.
  
  rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
  make coffee
  drink coffee
  relax
  
Run and enjoy.
  script/server 
  
Depending on how many edges you have it may take a bit of time to start up.
The reason for this is that the OQGraph table is volatile and needs to be created on 
startup.
